# Analyzing-FDI-Data-Using-Tableau
 I have taken a FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) dataset and analyze it from the perspective that your company wants to see in which sector it will be a beneficial idea to start the work so that your company can collaborate with FDI player and become successful.  Like any data science project methodology we have review the data, import the data, clean the data, massage the data, analyze and finally predict the data.  As a bonus I have also shown how you can cluster the data in tableau and how you can use the forecast option in tableau to predict future values.
